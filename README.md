### Description

If you want to adjust the brightness of a picture, rotate a picture with ANTI-ALIASING or AlphaBlend pictures together, maybe using an invisible mask color, and all that in vb and in just milliseconds... then you need this code! I wrote all the calculations in a C++ DLL, because it is much faster and easier to use, you just need a few lines of code to make incredible effects! in the zip-file there is the DLL and a VB-Demo to demonstrate the possibilities and the performance of my dll.<br>

<br>

NOTE: Version 3.0 is released, go to http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/showcode.asp?txtCodeId=21470<br>

<br>

UPDATED! 2.0: The new package now also includes a VB-Only-Version with the functions from the dll rewritten for VB, so you can use the stuff without the dll! (though the dll is faster than the still fast VB-code, so i would use the dll). I also included a BUMP MAPPING routine a BLUR filter and an IMPROVED ALPHA BLENDING routine.<br>

<br>

UPDATED! 2.1: Fixed a problem with 16 bit color depth. included MOSAIC filter.<br>

<br>

UPDATED! 2.2: Added some nice, useful timer- and counter-functions. See demo for description. I Also added a complete DOCUMENTATION of all functions with descriptions of all parameters to help you using my code (see "readme.txt").

<br>

<br>Test it and *please* vote for this really useful and good piece of code!<br>
